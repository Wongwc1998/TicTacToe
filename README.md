This is an implementation of the Odin Project's Tic Tac Toe(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) in Vite and React and styled with tailwind. I used React Context to manage the state of the game.

I installed the button of shadcn but forgot to delete it, and I have no idea how to delete it.
